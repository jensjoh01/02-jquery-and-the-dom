#### Single-line Summary
**Today, John and Mathew paired together. It took about 3hrs 15mins**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First we added our scripts. Took a while because article.js kept crashing our browser but we thought it was the jquery script.
  2. Completed the constructor function.
  3. Removed the template class.
  4. Appended the object parameters to the DOM.
